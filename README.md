 
# Attendance System using Face Recognition

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of an attendance system using face recognition technology. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize faces from images or live video streams and records attendance based on the recognized faces.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition.
- Database management for storing face encodings and corresponding identities.
- Attendance logging with timestamps.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
- Option to capture attendance from live video feed or images.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- dlib
- face_recognition
- tkinter (for GUI)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Attendance-system-using-Face-recognization-.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy dlib face_recognition pillow
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. The GUI will appear, providing options to perform different tasks.
3. You can choose to add new faces to the database by clicking on the appropriate button and following the instructions.
4. To take attendance, select the appropriate option (live video feed or image).
5. After attendance is taken, the system will log the attendance with timestamps.
